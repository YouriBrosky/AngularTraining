#### app-routing.module.ts

1. Create a new file for the Root routing called `app-routing.module.ts`.

2. Create a variable called `APP_ROUTES` and instantiate this with a new `Route[]`.

3. Create a new `Route` in the array with an empty `path` `''` and `component` to `BooksComponent`
   
4. Export a variable `AppRoutesModule: ModuleWithProviders` and instantiate this with `RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES)`.
    > **RouterModule.forRoot()**
    >
    > With forRoot() an instance of the Router service is created. It is *important* that forRoot is used once in the entire application.
    > The Root Module should be the only place where forRoot() is used.

6. Import `AppRoutesModule` in `AppModule` and add this to the `imports` property of `NgModule`.

7. In the template of `AppComponent`, replace the tag `<ibs-books></ibs-books>` with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`.
