#### routerLink
To make the components reachable for the user from the interface, there need to be links in the application to the `Route`s. Angular provides the `routerLink` directive for this use.

1. Use the template below for the navigation bar in the application. You can put it below the placeholder `<!-- start NavigationBar -->` in the template of `AppComponent`.
```html
<div class="g--12 tile bg--teal no-margin-vertical">
  <div class="g--10 m--1 container no-margin-vertical">
    <div class="g--3 no-margin color--white">
      <a> Books </a>
    </div>
    <div class="g--3 no-margin color--white">
      <a> New </a>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

2. Add the directive `routerLink=""` to the `a`-tags.

3. Connect the `routerLink`s to the `paths` defined in `books-routing.module.ts`. Remember that the path's in `routerLink` directives are always relative.
  > **paths starting with `/`**
  >
  > When a path in a `routerLink` starts with a `/`, then this path is interpreted as absolute. 
  > This means that angular starts with the Root Module to find the route.

4. Check in the browser if the right components are loaded when using the links in the navigation bar.
