#### Template

#### [formGroup], formControlName

1. Bind the property `bookForm` to `<form>` by using `[formGroup]`.

2. Connect the `FormGroup`-properties `title`, `author`, `genre` en `reserved` of `bookForm` to `<input>`-fields with `formControlName`.

3. To fill the `select` with `<option>`s for the `genres`, use the `*ngFor` directive. Start with a no value `<option>` with the text `Pick a genre`.

     > **[value] & [ngValue]**
     > 
     > For setting the value property on select you might want to use an Object instead of a string for the value of the option.
     > But, when using []-binding on HTML Elements, you always bind a `string` value to the property. This means objects will be set as `[Object]object`.
     > Solution:
     > [value] only works for string values. Is useful for simple data selections, like days, months or years.
     > [ngValue] works with Objects and Arrays, and is necessary if you want to get a more complex result from the select.
     
4. Try entering values and submitting your form in the browser. 
   Also look what the value of the form is when you have not touched it or when you've cleared the fields.
