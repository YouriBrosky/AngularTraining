#### Feature Module (BooksModule)

It's a good idea to separate the code into modules. This also adds the benefit to easily lazy load the module if that need comes.
Here we'll make a new `BooksModule` which will contain everything related to books.

1. Create the file `books.module.ts` in the folder `books`
    
2. Export a new class called `BooksModule`, or any name following the [style guide](https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#general-naming-guidelines).

3. Decorate the class with `@NgModule`, which also gets a configuration object as a parameter.

4. Set the properties `declarations:[]` and `exports: []` in the configuration object, and add `BooksComponent` into both arrays.
  > ** exports: [] **
  > 
  > This array holds the components which we want to be able to use outside the `BooksModule`
  > Otherwise their selectors can only be used in components within `BooksModule`

5. Add `imports: []` to the configuration object, and put `CommonModule` into the array.
  > ** CommonModule **
  > 
  > `CommonModule` holds the common directives (ngFor, ngIf, ...) and pipse (json, currency, async, ..) of Angular.
  > You will probably import the `CommonModule` into every Feature Module. This will not result in a bigger payload for each module.
  > The Angular CLI (& Webpack) will put all commonly imported modules into its own file when creating a production build.

6. Check the browser to see an error in the console, which on of the suggestions are we following?
    Fix the error accordingly.

7. Remove `BooksComponent` from `AppModule`. Also delete the TypeScript import.

8. Add `BooksModule` to the `imports: []` of `AppModule`.
