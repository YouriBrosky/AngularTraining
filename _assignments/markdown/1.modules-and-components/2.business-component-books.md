#### Business Components (BooksComponent)
In this assignment we will make add a Bussines Component to the application that will manage the books screen.

1. Create in the folder `books` the following files:
    * `books.component.ts`
    * `books.component.html`

2. Create a TypeScript class `BooksComponent` and decorate this with `@Component`,
   Set the `selector` property to `ibs-books` and `templateUrl` to `./books.component.html`
   
   > templateUrl's in `@Component` are relative and always have to be prefixed with './'.
    
3. We've created an interface in `app/books/models/book.interface` which contains the properties for a `Book`
  Import this interface into `BooksComponene`, and add a property called `books` that will hold a `Book[]`

4. Initilize the property, you can use the [data on the bottom of the page](#data). These are the books that we will show initially in the application. 
Later in the day we will be getting the data from a server.
   
5. Cut everything from `<!-- Start Books Component -->` to `<!-- End Books Component -->` from the template from`AppComponent`, 
and paste this in the template of `BooksComponent`.

6. Back in the template of `AppComponent`, add the selector of `BookComponent` in the place where you cut the template from.

7. To actually use the component in `AppComponent`, we need to declare `BooksComponent` in the `AppModule`.
  
8. Check in the browser if there are no error message. You will also see a difference in Augury, with the newly made components.
