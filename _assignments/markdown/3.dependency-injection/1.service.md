#### books.service

1. Create a new file called `books.service.ts` in the folder `app/books` and create a new class `BooksService`.

2. Add a methode called `getBooks` with a return type `Book[]`, which will return the books.
    Cut and paste the data from `BooksComponent` into this methode, we will replace this with a Http call later in the assignment.
    
3. Decorate the service with the `@Injectable({providedIn: 'root'})` decorator. Adding this decorator makes the class available for dependency
   injection in other services or component.

#### Injection
  
1. In `BooksComponent`, inject `BooksService` by adding `booksService:BooksService` to the constructor of `BooksComponent`.
   Don't forget the `private` keyword, so the service is immediately bound to `this` of the `BookService`.
    
2. Add `implements OnInit` to the class definition if you haven't already.

    > ** Best practice: OnInit & ngOnInit() **
    > 
    > It's a best practice to handle data in component in any of the life-cycle events, and not the constructor.
    > See [life cycle](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks) for a detailed explanation.

3. Create the method `ngOnInit` in the component and call get the books from the `booksService`.
   For now, you can directly set the property `books` in the component to the result of the method.
