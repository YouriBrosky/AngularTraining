It's possible that a user enters a url that is not registered in the application. In this case, the user should get an error message and maybe an option to go to an existing page.
To make this happen, we'll create a `NotFoundComponent`, declare it with the `RootModule` and add a route configuration to handle this scenario.

## NotFoundComponent
1. Use the Angular CLI to generate a component, or create it manually if you like the practice.
```
npx ng g c not-found -m app
```

2. Show an error message to the user

3. add an link to navigate to a valid page. In this case we'll navigate to the url '/', aka the landing url.

## Route configuration
To `catch` all the routes that are not registered in the Angular application, a special `path` is available: `**`.
This path *needs to be the last entry* of the entire route configuration for the application.

1. Add the following route configuration to the `root routing` module:
```javascript
{ path: '**', component: NotFoundComponent }
```

2. Make sure that the import of `AppRoutes` in `app.module` is *after* the import of the `BooksModule`.
  > *try it out*
  > Put the `AppRoutes` before the `BooksModule` in the imports.
  > what happens if you try to go to `/books`?
  > Have a look at the Augury plugin to see if you can figure out why.
