#### app-routing.module.ts

1. Create a new file for the Root routing called `app-routing.module.ts`.

2. Create a variable called `APP_ROUTES` and instantiate this with a new `Route[]`.

3. Create a new `Route` definition with an empty `path` `''` which does a redirect to `books` and add this to `APP_ROUTES`. 
    Remember to put `pathMatch` to `full` to this route is only executed when the path is *exactly* `'/'`.

    ```javascript
    <Route>{ path: '', pathMatch: 'full', redirectTo: '' }
    ```

    > **redirectTo**
    >
    > Because we want to immediately redirect to books when we hit the landing page, we make use of the redirect property.
    > A different scenario would be a landing page, like `HomeComponent`, where the user sees relevant information.

4. Export a variable `AppRoutes: ModuleWithProviders` and instantiate this with `RouterModule.forRoot(APP_ROUTES)`.
    > **RouterModule.forRoot()**
    >
    > With forRoot() an instance of the Router service is created. It is *important* that forRoot is used once in the entire application.
    > The Root Module should be the only place where forRoot() is used.

6. Import `AppRoutes` in `AppModule` and add this to the `imports` property of `NgModule`.

7. Replace in the template of `AppComponent` the tag `<ibs-books></ibs-books>` with `<router-outlet></router-outlet>`.
