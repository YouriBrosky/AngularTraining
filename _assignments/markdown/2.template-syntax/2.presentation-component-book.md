#### BookComponent
The book component shows all the properties of a book. 

1. Create a new folder named `book` in the folder `books`, with two files
    * `book.component.ts`
    * `book.component.html`

2. Create a new class in `book.component.ts` and decorate it with the @Component decorator. Set the `selector` and `templateUrl` properties.
    
2. Declare the component with the `BooksModule`.

3. Give the component an `@Input` property called `book`.

4. Show the the properties of `book` using `interpolation` and `[]` in the template of `BooksComponent`.

5. Use the `selector` of `BookComponent` in `books.component.html`, and give it the `selectedBook` for the `@Input` book.

6. The first time `BooksComponent` is initialized the property `selectedBook` is `undefined`, and it won't be possible to get properties shown in the template.
  Check the console in the browser to see the error, and fix accordingly.

7. Set ngIf in the template of `BooksComponent` where `selectedBook` is read. This will not show the element until there is a value for `selectedBook`.

8. Show the price with the [Currency Pipe](https://angular.io/api/common/CurrencyPipe) and the Euro symbol.
