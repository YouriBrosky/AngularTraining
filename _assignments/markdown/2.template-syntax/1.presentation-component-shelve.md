#### shelve.component

1. Create a new folder named `shelve` in the folder `books`, with two files
    * `shelve.component.ts`
    * `shelve.component.html`

2. Create a new class called `ShelveComponent` and decorate this with @Component. 
      Set the properties of `selector` and `templateUrl` to `ibs-shelve` and `./shelve.component.html` respectively.

3. Add `ShelveComponent` to the `declarations: []` of `BooksModule`

##### Binding: @Input() 
1. Give `ShelveComponent` a property called `books` and decorate this with `@Input()`.

2. Cut the HTML between `<!-- Start ShelveComponent -->` and `<!-- End ShelveComponent -->` paste it into the template of `ShelveComponent`.

3. Back in the template of `BooksComponent`, set the selector of `ShelveComponent` between `<!-- Start ShelveComponent -->` and `<!-- End ShelveComponent -->` .

4. Show the titels of `books` in a `<button>` element with *ngFor and interpolation

5. To get the books from `BooksComponent` into `ShelveComponent`, add `[books]="books"` in the template of `BooksComponent` in the tag `<ibs-shelve>`. This is [Property binding](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#property-binding--property-)

6. Check the browser for any errors. If you have Augury installed, you can do some interesting things with the `@Input` decorator on `ShelveComponent`.

##### Events: @Output() 
When a button is clicked, we want to show the selected book in `BooksComponent`. To get this done, we need to listen for an [event](https://angular.io/guide/template-syntax#event-binding---event-) from `ShelveComponent` in `BooksComponent`.

1. In `ShelveComponent`, create a new `@Output` property called `select` and instantiate it with an `EventEmitter<Book>`.
    The `EventEmitter` must be imported from `@angular/core`.

2. Create a method `onSelect` with a paramter `book:Book`, and call from this method the `@Output` property `select.emit()`.

3. To call `onSelect` from the template, we will listen for the `(click)` event of `<button>`.
   Since we have access to an instance of `book` in each element thanks to `*ngFor="let book of books"`, we can pass this from the template to `onSelect`.

4. In `BooksComponent`, add a property called `selectedBook`, and type it as `Book`.
    
5. Create a method on `BooksComponent` called `selectBook`. This will get a parameter called `book`.
    set the property `selectedBook` to value of the incoming parameter.
    
6. To connect the event from `ShelveComponent` to the method on `BooksComponent`, we need to listen for `(select)=""` from the element `<ibs-shelve>`.
    Set `selectBook($event)` between the quotes. `$event` is a pseudo-variable, which will tell Angular to get the arguments from the event and pass them trough.
