# Template Syntax

The [Template Syntax](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html) is used to render the data from 
the component in the template, react to events from the user and to modify the DOM structure. 

In this assigment we will show the book tites in a list of buttons which will get the data from the Business Component `BooksComponent`. When a user clicks one of the buttons, this selected book will be shown next to the list of book titles.

We will make use of `Presentation components` to show the data and handle the user input.

## [Techniques](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/template-syntax.html)
* property binding
