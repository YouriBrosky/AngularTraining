# Material design

The material design table offers a lot of features you can use in the inventory component. And the material design
library offers also other components that you can use in your own applications.


### BrowserAnimationModule

1. Add the `BrowserAnimationModule` to the `AppModule`. You are going to need it later, because some of @angular/material's
components have built in animations.

### Material table features

Add extra features to your table. Use the [documentation](https://material.angular.io/components/table/overview) to find out how.

1. Make the table sortable by clicking on a table header.
2. Add pagination to the table.

### Material design components

Have a look at all the [components](https://material.angular.io/components/categories) that are available in the material
design library, and see how you can use them in our application. For example:

1. Use Material Design [buttons](https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview) instead of the buttons we use now.
2. Use Material Design [form controls](https://material.angular.io/components/button/overview) in the form for creating new books.
3. Import a [theme](https://material.angular.io/guide/theming) to customize the look and feel of the application.
4. Have a look at layout, navigation, popups and progress spinners and use your imagination to make the application even more
  beautiful.
