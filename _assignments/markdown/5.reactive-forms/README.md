# Reactive Forms

Almost every application has a form in which users can enter data. Such a form usually has validation for the inputs, 
and tells the user when a field has a wrong value. The form is then sent to the backend for further validation of 
business rules, and eventually saved.

In this assignment, we will make a form that will store a new book on the server.
